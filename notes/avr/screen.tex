\section{Using \textbf{screen} for a serial console}
The \textbf{screen} utility makes setting up a serial console easy.  A
basic invocation is
\usercmd{screen /dev/ttywhatever 9600}{}
where the baud rate for the session is set to 9600\footnotemark{}.  If more
parameters are needed, they can be added in a comma-separated list as
in
\usercmd{screen /dev/ttywhatever 9600,cs8,-parenb,-cstopb,-hupcl}{}
where now communication is explicitly configured to use 9600 baud, 8
data bits per byte, no parity bit, one stop bit, and to ignore hangup
signals.  The parameters in the list follow notation used by the
\textbf{stty} utility.  An easy way to explicitly set all the
parameters is thus to invoke it using
\usercmd{stty -F /dev/ttywhatever -a}{\verbatiminput{stty_out.txt}}
which will show you how the serial port is configured with the same
parameters taken by \textbf{screen}.

\footnotetext{\textbf{udev} sets the group ownership of the CDC tty
node to \texttt{uucp}, and I don't seem to be able to change this with
a custom rule.  I thus have to add users to the \texttt{uucp} group
for these \textbf{screen} commands to work.}
