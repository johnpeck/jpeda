\section{Working with \texttt{gnetlist}}

\subsection{Generating a netlist}

The command
\begin{center}
	\texttt{gnetlist -g PCB <input.sch> -o <output.net>}
\end{center}
will create a netlist readable by both you and PCB. The file will have three columns: net name, starting pin, and ending pin.


\subsection{Generating a bill of materials (BOM)}
The \texttt{-g} flag for gnetlist allows you to specify a guile script to be run.  Scripts for BOM creation are located in \verb8/usr/share/gEDA/scheme8, and some are described in table \ref{bom_scripts}.
\input{bom_table}


For example, the command
\begin{center}
	\texttt{gnetlist -g bom <input.sch> -o <output.bom>}
\end{center}
will generate a BOM.  You must have a file called ``attribs'' in the directory from which gnetlist is invoked.  This file should just contain a column of attributes you want included in the BOM.  An example is:


\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{2cm}
\verbatiminput{attribs}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
