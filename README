This is a repository for open-source electronics design automation resources:
* Footprints for use with the PCB project
	(http://pcb.gpleda.org/)
* Schematic symbols for use with the gEDA project
	(http://www.gpleda.org/index.html)
* Notes on the gEDA --> PCB design flow
* Notes on developing with AVR microcontrollers on a gentoo system
* The kitgen and buygen scripts to automate kitting
	- My part number maps to distributor part numbers are included
	- My part number maps to part descriptions are included
	
You will need the doctools project to build the gEDA and AVR notes.  This is
included in the project as a submodule, and can be pulled in using:
	1. git clone git@github.com:johnpeck/jpeda
	2. git submodule init
	3. git submodule update
